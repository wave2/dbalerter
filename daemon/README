About dbAlerter
================
Database Alerter = Something wrong with your DB?  Well now you know what!

After suffering at the hands of external monitoring tools, I decided to
write something that would run standalone and provide detailed notification
for database issues that often elude a busy DBA.

Initially focussing on MySQL, I recently rewrote the daemon with a view to
supporting more database platforms in the near future.
